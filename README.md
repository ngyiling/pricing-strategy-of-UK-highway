# Price Optimisation and Capacity Allocation of a UK highway

This aim of this report is to carry out price optimisation and capacity allocation of Dartford Crossing, UK - one of the busiest highways M25 in England - in accordance to 3 potential objectives: maximise toll revenue, minimise emissions, or maximise throughput. 

Considering that the heavy traffic remains a big challenge to the government, two strategies were proposed and assessed in this study: 
  1. Time-based differentiation by vehicle type through Peak-Period Pricing; 
  2. Capacity allocation of high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes based on vehicle occupancy.

The first approach considers the addition of peak period price, from 7 to 9 am and 4 to 6 pm, to the current pricing structure as the current toll charges drivers a single price between 6 am and 10 pm subjecting to their vehicle types. Whilst the second approach considers the allocation demand of HOT to maximise the throughput of the Crossing under the capacity constraint whilst prioritising multi-occupancy vehicles at the HOT lane.

**Methodology:**
<br />
To model the first approach, the demand of each vehicle type was determined using simulated willingness-to-pay (WTP) data by linear regression, followed by non-linear programming to find the optimal peak and non-peak prices. For the second approach, the expected demand for HOT lanes among single-occupancy (SO) vehicles and multi-occupancy (MO) vehicles were calculated using the arrival probabilities, and linear programming was then used to model the HOT lane allocation of SO and MO vehicles.


**Results:** 
- Time-based pricing approach suggests that the improvements achieved would depend on the governmentâ€™s objective, whether to maximise revenue, minimise emissions or maximise throughput. 
- HOT lane allocation showed that the number of single-occupancy and multi-occupancy vehicles in the HOT lane should be controlled to minimise emissions. By limiting the number of HOT lane tickets for solo drivers, the HOT lane throughput can be maximised. Drivers who want to purchase HOT toll would need to purchase online in advance, but the rest of the ticket can be purchased online in advance or pay by mid-night the following day, and with no capacity limit.
